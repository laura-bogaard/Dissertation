# final model matched with dredge and has treatment, day, forage, tide, as significant predictors of distance-- but RL is a function of distance... hm

acf(res)# baad
plot(fit, res)#residuals by fitted, some pattern, prob because of zeros
plot(treat,res)# res by predictor, spread uneven
plot(time,res)#residuals by predictor
plot(trial,res)#residuals by ramdom effect
plot(site,res)#residuals by random effect
hist(res,breaks=c(30))#histogram of residuals, looks ok(ish)
#qq plot for random effects
#histogram & qqnorm plots of residuals
